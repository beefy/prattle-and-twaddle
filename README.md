I made this project a while ago on bitbucket and recently moved it over to github. The most recent version wasn't able to move, so this version is not the latest, but I think it's pretty close. It has simple rendering (VBOs), lighting, picking, and lighting. I'm probably going to continue working on this the summer of 2015.

The steps to set up this application are unclear and there are multiple ways to do it. You must add "JOGL" to your build path and include the necessary .jar files. See tutorials from the JOGL website (jogamp.org) for more details about building JOGL in eclipse. We are working toward simplifying this process.

### What is this repository for? ###

This is the game engine of Carnivorous Exports. Because it is still so small, it has yet to be compiled into an easily implemented package. Right now, this is more of a demo of the engine's capabilities. After cloning this repository, you can simply edit and add to it.
